    <p>The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for the blind by using an embedded system to detect and identify objects in the physical world, sending the information to a website and a mobile application, where AI technology is used to describe the objects and their surroundings in real-time. The system can also help the blind navigate through obstacles by providing audio and haptic feedback through the mobile application to alert them of potential hazards.</p>
